# Vehicle Management System ðŸš—

[![.NET Build](https://github.com/1244Matt1244/vehicle_management_app/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/1244Matt1244/vehicle_management_app/actions)

**Modern Vehicle Inventory System** built on the .NET 9 ecosystem with a clean, layered architecture. This application provides complete CRUD operations for vehicle makes and modelsâ€”with advanced filtering, sorting, and pagingâ€”enforced with async/await, dependency injection via Ninject, and mapping via AutoMapper.

## Overview

- **Project.MVC**: Presentation layer with controllers, views, and view models.
- **Project.Service**: Business logic layer with EF Core models, the `VehicleService` class (supporting sorting, filtering, and paging), and AutoMapper integration.
- **Project.Tests**: Automated tests using xUnit and Moq.

---

## Architecture & Workflow

The system is built with a clear separation of concerns between the presentation (MVC), business logic (Service), and data access (EF Core) layers. The diagram below illustrates the flow from development in Visual Studio to database management via SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## Features

- **Complete Vehicle Management:**  
  Full CRUD operations for vehicle makes and models.
- **Advanced Filtering & Sorting:**  
  Dynamic pagination, sorting, and search functionality.
- **Layered Architecture:**  
  Strict separation between MVC, Service, and Data layers.
- **Asynchronous Programming:**  
  Async/await enforced across all layers.
- **Dependency Injection & IoC:**  
  Ninject is used for DI to promote testability and loose coupling.
- **Object Mapping:**  
  AutoMapper converts EF models to DTOs/view models.
- **Global Error Handling:**  
  Custom middleware returns structured JSON error responses.
- **CI/CD & Docker Support:**  
  Automated builds, tests, and containerized deployments.
- **HTTPS Security:**  
  Enforced HTTPS using development certificates.

---

## Requirements & Roadmap

### Requirements

- **Database Setup:**  
  - **VehicleMake:** Columns: `Id`, `Name`, `Abrv` (e.g., BMW, Ford, Volkswagen)  
  - **VehicleModel:** Columns: `Id`, `MakeId`, `Name`, `Abrv` (e.g., 128, 325, X5 for BMW)
- **Solution Structure:**  
  - **Project.Service:** EF Core models and `VehicleService` with CRUD operations (including sorting, filtering, and paging).  
  - **Project.MVC:** Administration views for vehicle makes and models (with filtering by make).
- **Implementation Details:**  
  - Use async/await throughout.
  - Abstract classes with interfaces for unit testing.
  - Enforce IoC/DI using Ninject (constructor injection preferred).
  - Use AutoMapper for mapping.
  - Use EF Core (Code First) for database access.
  - Return view models (not EF models) in MVC.
  - Return proper HTTP status codes.

### Roadmap

#### 2025 Priorities
- [x] Implement Core CRUD Functionality for Vehicle Makes/Models  
- [x] Enhance Pagination, Sorting & Filtering  
- [ ] Integrate additional security measures  
- [ ] Refine global error handling and logging  

#### Quality Goals
- **High Test Coverage:** Robust automated testing.
- **Global Error Handling:** Precise and structured exception reporting.
- **Clean Architecture:** Strict separation of concerns across layers.

## Database Migrations & Build Process

### Database Migrations

Clean existing migrations and create a new migration to fix foreign key conflicts:

```bash
# Clean existing migrations
rm -rf Project.Service/Migrations/

# Create a new migration
dotnet ef migrations add FixForeignKeyConflict --project Project.Service --startup-project Project.MVC

# Apply the new migration
dotnet ef database update --project Project.Service --startup-project Project.MVC --verbose
```

### Build Process

Perform a full clean build and run the application:

```bash
dotnet clean && dotnet restore && dotnet build
dotnet run --project Project.MVC
```
