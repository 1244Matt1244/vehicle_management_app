# Vehicle Management System ðŸš—

[![.NET Build](https://github.com/1244Matt1244/vehicle_management_app/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/1244Matt1244/vehicle_management_app/actions)

**Modern Vehicle Inventory System** built on the .NET 9 ecosystem with a clean, layered architecture. This application provides complete CRUD operations for vehicle makes and modelsâ€”with advanced filtering, sorting, and pagingâ€”all enforced using async/await, dependency injection via Ninject, and mapping via AutoMapper.

## Overview

- **Project.MVC**: Presentation layer (controllers, views, and view models).
- **Project.Service**: Business logic layer with EF Core models, the `VehicleService` class (supporting sorting, filtering, and paging), and AutoMapper integration.
- **Project.Tests**: Automated tests using xUnit and Moq.

## Architecture & Workflow

The system is built using a layered architecture ensuring clear separation of concerns. The diagram below shows the complete flowâ€”from development in Visual Studio to data management with SQL Server, managed via SSMS.

### How It Works

- **Development in Visual Studio:**  
  Code is authored and maintained using Visual Studio.
- **MVC Layer:**  
  Controllers receive HTTP requests, interact with view models, and send proper HTTP status codes.
- **Service Layer:**  
  Implements business logic (CRUD, filtering, sorting, paging) and uses AutoMapper to convert EF Core entities to DTOs.
- **Data Access:**  
  ApplicationDbContext (via EF Core) handles database interactions with a SQL Server backend.
- **Database Management:**  
  SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is used to monitor and manage the database.

---

## Features

- **Complete Vehicle Management:**  
  CRUD operations for both vehicle makes and models.
- **Advanced Filtering & Sorting:**  
  Dynamic sorting, search, and pagination.
- **Layered Architecture:**  
  Strict separation between MVC, Service, and Data layers.
- **Asynchronous Programming:**  
  Async/await is enforced throughout.
- **Dependency Injection (DI):**  
  Ninject is used for IoC, ensuring classes are testable and loosely coupled.
- **Object Mapping:**  
  AutoMapper is used to map between EF Core models and view models/DTOs.
- **Global Exception Handling:**  
  Custom middleware handles errors and returns structured JSON responses.
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  Automated builds and tests with GitHub Actions.
- **Docker Support:**  
  Containerized deployment for consistent environments.
- **HTTPS Security:**  
  Enforced HTTPS with development certificates.

## Requirements & Roadmap

### Requirements

- **Database:**  
  - **VehicleMake:** Columns: `Id`, `Name`, `Abrv` (e.g., BMW, Ford, Volkswagen)  
  - **VehicleModel:** Columns: `Id`, `MakeId`, `Name`, `Abrv` (e.g., 128, 325, X5 for BMW)
- **Solution Structure:**  
  - **Project.Service:** Contains EF models and `VehicleService` class for CRUD (including sorting, filtering, and paging).
  - **Project.MVC:** Provides administration views for makes and models with filtering by make.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Enforce async/await across all layers.
  - Abstract classes using interfaces for unit testing.
  - Use IoC/DI (via Ninject) with constructor injection.
  - Use AutoMapper for DTO mapping.
  - Use EF Core (Code First) for database access.
  - Return view models (not EF models) in MVC.
  - Return proper HTTP status codes.

### Roadmap

#### 2025 Priorities
- [x] Implement Core CRUD Functionality for Vehicle Makes/Models  
- [x] Enhance Pagination, Sorting & Filtering  
- [ ] Integrate additional security measures  
- [ ] Refine global error handling and logging  

#### Quality Goals
- **High Test Coverage:** Robust automated testing.
- **Global Error Handling:** Precise and structured exception reporting.
- **Clean Architecture:** Strict separation of concerns across layers.

## Database Migrations & Build Process

### Database Migrations

Clean existing migrations and create a new migration to fix foreign key conflicts:

```bash
# Clean existing migrations
rm -rf Project.Service/Migrations/

# Create and apply a new migration
dotnet ef migrations add FixForeignKeyConflict --project Project.Service --startup-project Project.MVC
dotnet ef database update --project Project.Service --startup-project Project.MVC --verbose
```

### Build Process

For a complete clean build and to run the application, use:

```bash
dotnet clean && dotnet restore && dotnet build
dotnet run --project Project.MVC
```
